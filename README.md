# fast-universal

This repository contains the source code for Fast-UAP: An Algorithm for Expediting Universal Adversarial Perturbation Generation Using the Orientation of Perturbation Vectors

`tensorflow-gpu` version we use:1.1.0

get started: `python demo_DenseNet121.py`

You can also compute a fast universal perturbation for your model by following the struture in `demo_DenseNet121.py`.
