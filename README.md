# fast-universal

This repository contains the source code for Fast-UAP: An Algorithm for Speeding up Universal Adversarial Perturbation Generation with Orientation of Perturbation Vectors

Started: `python demo_DenseNet121.py`

You can also compute a fast universal perturbation for your model by following the struture in `demo_DenseNet121.py`.
